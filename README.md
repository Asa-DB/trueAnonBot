## what it does

- `/submit` opens a modal for an anonymous vent
- `/submit` can also be used in bot DMs
- `/reply` explains how anonymous follow-ups work
- the bot asks for DM confirmation before it sends anything
- the mod review message has approve and reject buttons
- rejection can include an optional typed-out moderator reason that gets DMd back
- approval creates a forum post and keeps the sender hidden from the public thread
- after approval, the original poster gets a DM control panel for anonymous follow-ups and thread actions
- the user control panel can post follow-ups and let the original poster close, resolve, or delete their own thread
- moderators can request more information and the bot relays the answer back in DMs
- mods can close or resolve a thread with buttons
- dead threads get auto-locked after 8 hours with no new messages
- optional sticky messages can be reposted on a timer in one channel
- optional York Tech newsletter watching can post new Spartan Review issues as embeds in a channel
- optional AI-powered daily QOTD can post once a day on an Eastern Time schedule
- `/promotegrades` lets the server owner roll class roles forward by one year and posts an `@everyone` graduation embed

## newsletter watcher

- this polls the York Tech news page and looks for the newest article whose title starts with `Spartan Review`
- when it finds a new issue, it sends a polished embed with buttons to open the article
- if `NEWSLETTER_PING_ROLE_ID` is set, that role gets pinged with the post
- on the first startup with newsletter watching enabled, the bot records the current latest issue and waits for the next new one instead of reposting the existing article

## qotd

- this uses an API key and defaults to OpenRouter's `openrouter/free` router
- by default it checks every minute and posts once per day at `6:00 PM` Eastern
- if the bot is offline at exactly 6:00 PM, it will post later the same evening when the bot comes back up
- if `QOTD_PING_ROLE_ID` is set, that role gets pinged with the question
- each QOTD post immediately opens its own thread for replies
- it keeps a short history of recent questions so the AI prompt can avoid obvious repeats
- if the API request fails, it waits 5 minutes and tries again
- if you want a different model later, set `QOTD_MODEL` to another OpenRouter model id or a `:free` variant

## how anonymous it really is

- this is mostly anonymous in normal server use, not perfect anonymity
- the public forum thread does not show who sent the vent
- moderators using the bot do not get shown the sender identity in the review flow, thread tools, or follow-up relay
- the bot itself still has to know which discord account sent the vent so it can DM confirmations, rejection reasons, and follow-up questions
- this is not anonymity from discord, and it is not anonymity from anyone with direct access to the bot process or host
- those limits are not this bot being weird, they are basic limits of how discord and discord bots fundamentally work
- to keep DM follow-ups and moderator relays working reliably, the bot stores the active sender-to-thread routing on disk while a vent is open
- once a vent is rejected, closed, resolved, or auto-closed, that active routing is removed

## thread actions

- `Close Thread`: shuts the thread down without saying the issue was solved
- `Resolved`: marks it as handled and then shuts the thread down

## bot permissions

the bot should be able to:

- use slash commands
- send messages and embeds
- send DMs
- create public threads / forum posts
- manage threads
- read the mod queue channel

if `MODROLE` is set, only that role can use the sensitive mod controls

if `MODROLE` is not set, those controls fall back to `Manage Threads`

for `/promotegrades`, the bot also needs:

- `Manage Roles`
- the `Server Members Intent` enabled in the Discord developer portal
- its highest bot role placed above all five configured class roles
